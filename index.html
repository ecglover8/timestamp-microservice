        <p>A timestamp microservice API for Freecodecamp backend certification.</p>
        <p>This API will return a JSON object containing both the UNIX time in milliseconds and a formatted date string. You can use this API by going to the website and using an argument after the final "/".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have a number for the argument, then you will receive that same number back along with the date string corresponding to that number of milliseconds.</li>
            <li>If you have a date string for the argument, then you will receive that date string back along with the number of milliseconds it was at 00:00:00 UTC on that day.</li>
            <li>If you have "now" as the argument, you will receive the number of milliseconds and the date string for right now.</li>
            <li>If your argument is not one of the above things, you will receive "null" as your JSON response.</li>
        </ul>
